# Cell generator

A cheat written in RustðŸ¦€ for changing cell value in the game Dead Cells.
I use an external memory manipulation hack to change the cell counter value.
Utilizing the [toy-arms](https://github.com/pseuxide/toy-arms) Rust library for low-level memory and process functions.

The intention is purely educational and serves as POC, and I do not endorse cheating for malicious purposes.
